    "Proteins are for the most part defined by the aminoacid sequences that compose them. However, due to the nature of the aminoacids, proteins have more complex structures that characterize them.\n",

    "\n",
    "Classifying correctly which portion of a protein assumes a given secondary structure isn't an easy task, but it can be seen that there are links between specific patterns of aminoacids and given secondary structures.\n",
    "As an example, in $\\alpha$-helices (one type of secondary structure) every third aminoacid along the sequence will tend to be hydrophobic. Also, regions richer of *alanine (A)* and *leucine (L)* will tend to form helices. (see *Gollery, Martin. \"Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis\", David W. Mount. Pag. 387-388*)"

However, we have more than $70000$ aminoacids, and taking one out won't affect the model in any significant way.  \n",

    "We also see how the quantity of $\\beta$-sheets (both real and predicted) has a huge impact in the classification of proteins.\n",
    "The accuracy meaures are also pretty important, meaning the our model will prefer to assign a given classification based on the quality of the individual secondary structure predictions. This makes sense, as it means that when we have a low accuracy the model will be more likely to assign the most common overall secondary structure.\n",

    "Also, the number of *Leucine (L)* and *Arginine (R)* is a useful predictor of the overall structure: as mentioned before, *leucine* is mostly encountered in $\\alpha$-helices, and the output of the model confirms our theoretical knowledge."
