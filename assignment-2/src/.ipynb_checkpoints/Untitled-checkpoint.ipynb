    "Classifying correctly which portion of a protein assumes a given secondary structure isn't an easy task, but it can be seen that there are links between specific patterns of aminoacids and given secondary structures.\n",
    "As an example, in $\\alpha$-helices (one type of secondary structure) every third aminoacid along the sequence will tend to be hydrophobic. Also, regions richer of *alanine (A)* and *leucine (L)* will tend to form helices. (see *Gollery, Martin. \"Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis\", David W. Mount. Pag. 387-388*)"

    "\n",
    "We also see how the quantity of $\\beta$-sheets (both real and predicted) has a huge impact in the classification of proteins.\n",
    "The accuracy meaures are also pretty important, meaning the our model will prefer to assign a given classification based on the quality of the individual secondary structure predictions. This makes sense, as it means that when we have a low accuracy the model will be more likely to assign the most common overall secondary structure.\n",

    "Also, the number of *Leucine (L)* and *Arginine (R)* is a useful predictor of the overall structure: as mentioned before, *leucine* is mostly encountered in $\\alpha$-helices, and the output of the model confirms our theoretical knowledge."
